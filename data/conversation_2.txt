**Conversation:**

**Carol:** Hi, Grandma.

**Grandma:** Well, good morning, Carol. Thank you so much for coming to visit me. I don't get many visitors.

**Carol:** It's my pleasure. I've missed you. The countryside here is so beautiful; it's a nice escape from college life.

**Grandma:** Ah, I remember those days. Busy with books and bustling around. How's school treating you?

**Carol:** It's going well. Actually, one of my classes got me thinking about our family history.

**Grandma:** Is that so? I'd be happy to share what I know.

**Carol:** I'd love that. This homestead has always fascinated me. What's the story behind it?

**Grandma:** Well, this land was granted to your great-great-grandfather back in the homesteading days. It's been in our family ever since.

**Carol:** That's incredible. What was the original house like?

**Grandma:** Oh, the old house was something else. Built sturdy, but time took its toll. Especially after that earthquake in the '40s.

**Carol:** Earthquake? I didn't know Idaho had earthquakes.

**Grandma:** It was rare, but that one was a doozy. Shook the whole valley. The house suffered quite a bit.

**Carol:** What happened to it?

**Grandma:** Well, the foundation shifted, and the whole structure went a little... crooked. Only the kitchen floor stayed level. The rest of the house leaned in odd directions.

**Carol:** That sounds dangerous! Did you keep living there?

**Grandma:** We did. Didn't have much choice at the time. We got used to walking uphill to the bedroom and downhill to the parlor.

**Carol:** That's wild. What about the upstairs?

**Grandma:** Oh, the upstairs became off-limits. The stairs were too risky—they creaked and swayed. We used it for storage and hoped nothing important was up there.

**Carol:** Weren't you worried the house might collapse?

**Grandma:** Sometimes, especially during storms. But your grandpa was handy. He propped up beams and patched things as best he could.

**Carol:** He sounds resourceful.

**Grandma:** He was. Always tinkering. And then there was Bonita, our dog, who kept us company through it all.

**Carol:** Bonita?

**Grandma:** Yes, she was a stray that wandered onto the property one summer. Skinny little thing, but with the brightest eyes.

**Carol:** How did you decide to keep her?

**Grandma:** Well, she decided to keep us, I think. Followed your grandpa around everywhere. He couldn't shake her, so we took her in.

**Carol:** What was she like?

**Grandma:** Loyal and smart. She had this uncanny ability to sense when something was wrong with the house.

**Carol:** Really?

**Grandma:** Oh yes. One night, she started barking like mad. We thought maybe a coyote was nearby, but then we heard a beam crack in the living room. If we hadn't moved, it might've fallen on us.

**Carol:** Wow, she was a hero!

**Grandma:** She earned her keep, that's for sure.

**Carol:** Tell me more about life in the old house.

**Grandma:** Well, winters were the hardest. The gaps in the walls let in chilly drafts. We'd huddle in the kitchen since it was the warmest and most level room.

**Carol:** Did you have a fireplace?

**Grandma:** We did, but the chimney was damaged in the quake. Smoke didn't vent properly, so we relied on a wood-burning stove in the kitchen.

**Carol:** Sounds cozy, in a way.

**Grandma:** It had its charm. We'd tell stories, play cards. Your grandpa loved to play the fiddle, and Bonita would lie at our feet.

**Carol:** What about during the summers?

**Grandma:** Summers were lovely. The warped floors made for fun with marbles—they'd roll in unexpected directions! The kids thought it was the greatest game.

**Carol:** That's so endearing.

**Grandma:** It was a simple life. Hard work on the farm, but we found joy in the little things.

**Carol:** Did you ever think about moving?

**Grandma:** We did, especially as the house got worse. But it wasn't until after your mother was born that we could afford to build this new one.

**Carol:** Must have been hard to leave the old house behind.

**Grandma:** Bittersweet. It held so many memories, but it was time. Safety first, after all.

**Carol:** What happened to Bonita?

**Grandma:** She lived a long, happy life. When we built the new house, she seemed pleased. No more tilting floors to navigate!

**Carol:** Do you have any photos from back then?

**Grandma:** I believe I do. There's an old photo album in the cabinet.

**Carol:** May I see it?

**Grandma:** Of course, dear. Let me get it for you.

[Grandma retrieves a worn photo album and hands it to Carol.]

**Carol:** These are amazing! Is this you and Grandpa in front of the old house?

**Grandma:** Yes, that's on our fifth anniversary. See how the house leans a bit to the left?

**Carol:** It's noticeable even in the photo! And is that Bonita?

**Grandma:** Sure is, right between us. She never missed a photo opportunity.

**Carol:** She looks so happy.

**Grandma:** She was part of the family.

**Carol:** I love hearing these stories. It makes me feel connected to our history.

**Grandma:** I'm glad, dear. It's important to know where we come from.

**Carol:** Do you ever miss those days?

**Grandma:** Sometimes. Life was simpler then, though not easier. But I cherish the memories.

**Carol:** I wish I could have experienced it.

**Grandma:** You're making your own memories now. And someday, you'll share them with your grandchildren.

**Carol:** I hope so. Maybe I'll even bring them here to visit you.

**Grandma:** I'd like that very much.

**Carol:** Grandma, would you mind if I recorded some of your stories? I'd love to share them with the rest of the family.

**Grandma:** I think that's a wonderful idea.

**Carol:** Great! Maybe after lunch, we can sit down and you can tell me more about Grandpa and Bonita.

**Grandma:** I'd be happy to. Speaking of lunch, are you hungry?

**Carol:** Starving! Can I help with anything?

**Grandma:** You can set the table. The kitchen floor is still level, just like in the old house, so you shouldn't have any trouble.

[They both laugh.]

**Carol:** I'm glad some things never change.

**Grandma:** Indeed. Now, let's see what we can whip up.

[They move to the kitchen, continuing their conversation as they prepare the meal.]

**Carol:** Grandma, what's your favorite memory from the old house?

**Grandma:** Hmm, that's a tough one. But I think it's the evenings when your grandpa would play his fiddle, and we'd dance in the kitchen.

**Carol:** Even with the tilted floors?

**Grandma:** Especially because of the tilted floors! It made dancing quite the adventure.

**Carol:** That sounds magical.

**Grandma:** It was. Life wasn't always easy, but it was full of love.

**Carol:** Thank you for sharing all of this with me.

**Grandma:** Thank you for listening, Carol. It means a lot to have someone to pass these stories on to.

**Carol:** I'm honored. And I can't wait to hear more.
