Bob: Hi there! I'm Bob. I couldn't help but notice the cat toy peeking out of your bag.
Shirley: Oh, hello! I'm Shirley. Yes, I just picked up a new toy for my cat, Buffy.
Bob: What a coincidence! I'm a pet owner too. I have a dog named Rocky.
Shirley: That's lovely! How long have you had Rocky?
Bob: About three years now. He's a golden retriever. What about Buffy?
Shirley: Buffy's a five-year-old tabby. I adopted her from a shelter last year.
Bob: That's wonderful! Do you live nearby? I'm always looking for pet-friendly neighbors.
Shirley: Actually, I just moved into the apartment complex down the street.
Bob: No way! I live there too. We should arrange a pet playdate sometime.
Shirley: That sounds great, Bob! I'd love to meet Rocky, and I'm sure Buffy would enjoy the company.
